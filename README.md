# Getting Started to Write Better with OpenAI!

This project is using a powerful AI model created by [OpenAI](https://openai.com/api/) called GPT-3 to process inputs from users and produce helpful responses for specific purposes. In particular, this app is intended for people who want to improve their writing skills and have fun with smart writing using AI technology.

## Instructions

Before having fun with this project and its code, make sure you have [Node and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your machine.

After cloning the code to your local, run:

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.



## Notes

1. AI response is limited to 100 words only so you may find some responses incomplete. In those cases, there will be a sign of '...' included at the end of each response.

2. Responses will be saved for 1 hour only due to security concerns. Within 1 hour, you can leave the page or reload the page without losing your data. After that, all data will be lost.

3. Make sure your input is clear and specific enough in order to generate an accurate response for your purpose.
